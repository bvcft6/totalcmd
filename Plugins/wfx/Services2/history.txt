Version 0.4.2  [2014-07-25]
[+]  Added Chinese translation, thanks to SunX!
[+]  Added Russian translation, thanks to Alexander Gvaramiya (Nero Wolfe)!
[+]  Added translation_instructions.txt which contains some instructions
     for translators. I hope the pluginst.inf and Services2.lng files are
     not forgotten that often anymore ;)
[*]  (Hopefully) Fixed the issue that the icon of a service didn't reflect
     its real state when the option "Show service state in the extension
     column of TC's panel" was disabled
[*]  Service properties dialog, Advanced page:
     Repositioned the controls and made some of them wider to allow longer
     strings for translations
[*]  Fixed: Restart service function (in the service properties dialog)
     didn't show confirmation dialog to stop dependent services
[*]  Changed "file download": string padding is now based on the longest
     (translated) string in the whole "file" instead of a fixed value of
     20 characters. I hope this is better for translations.
[+]  Added a new option (not available in settings dialog)
     AddTxtExtensionOnDownload, see Services2.ini.sample for explanation
[*]  Some internal optimizations

Version 0.4.1  [2014-04-21]
[+]  Added Hungarian translation, thanks to Bluestar!
[+]  Added Danish translation, thanks to petermad!
[+]  Added Italian translation, thanks to squeeze69!
[*]  Made the settings dialog and plugin properties dialog wider to allow
     longer strings for translations
[*]  Return icon state strings in FsExtractCustomIcon properly to allow TC
     to cache them only once per state (should decrease memory consumption)
