=== History

--- 2.0b - JPEG support added. Rewrited on VCL, so size is huge :(
         - Sequential numbering added.
         - Lowercase extentions.
         - No file size yet. Still beta :)
--- 1.0b - PNG support added
--- 1.0a - first step

=== Known troubles
    - file sizes are 0
    - you can view each file for only once. Looking for bug :)
