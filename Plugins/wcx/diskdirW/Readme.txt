DiskDirW v1.1.2 - plugin for Total Commander

Initial developer and sources - Christian Ghisler

How to install this plugin (32 bit only):
This plugin now uses auto-install. Just double click the archive
inside of Total Commander to install it.

The plugin can be used like a packer (Files - Pack), although it
doesn't actually pack any file contents - just link to the
original files.

What it does:
The diskdirW plugin creates plain text list files which can be
opened in Word, Excel or other office tools which can format
TAB-delimited files, and then be formatted for printing.It can
also be used as a catalog tool: You can scan your CDs with it,
each to a file, and then search in these catalogs using the
Search command with the option "Search in archives".
List format is UTF-8 without BOM marker.
