The script CountExt.vbs calculates the number or the size (both absolute or relative) of files in a directory (and optional recursivelly in all subfolders) for up to 9 groups of files by means of their extensions. You can use this script amongst others in the "Find Files" dialogue, tab "Plugins" (to find directories, which does not contain a specific file type / files of a specific group of file extensions, for instance).

Change the configuration according to your wishes by editing the "User configurable area" of the script.


Script <CountExt.vbs>

INI <script.ini> for the script
