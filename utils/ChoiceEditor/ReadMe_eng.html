<H1><FONT COLOR=BLUE>ChoiceEditor</FONT> for <FONT COLOR=RED>Total Comander</FONT> version 1.95c</H1>

<H3>DESCRIPTION</H3>
<P>This utility allows you to assign any program installed on your system to open  various filetypes via Total Commander.<br>
As a result, whenever you hit F4 in Total Commander your file will be opened in the program you selected earlier and which you consider to be the most appropriate for viewing or editing that filetype.

<H3>INSTALLATION AND USE</H3>
<P>Unpack to any directory. Enter the program's full path in the Total Commander settings.
<br>(In the Configuration menu: Settings - Editing/Viewing - Program-editor)
<P>Now if you press F4 ChoiceEditor will appear and you will have to choose an editor/viewer to open the selected file. Your choice is stored in an ini file which is created in the ChoiceEditor folder.<br>
Once you have opened a file of the selected type in your favorite editor/viewer, that filetype will be always opened in it.

<H3>POTENTIALITIES</H3>
<UL><LI>Automatic interface language selection (english/russian). Depends on your current system language settings.
<LI>Editing files in archives and on FTP servers.
<LI>Editing of a new file (created by pressing Shift+F4) will be also carried out in your selected editor.
<LI>This utility does not make any changes to your system registry. All the settings are stored in an ini file created in the program's folder. The ini file is a plain text file so you can edit it manually.
<LI>If you wish to make a choice just before you open a file then it is possible to add the necessary extension to the ChoiceEditor's ini file. If the same extension is specified more than once then on pressing F4 the selected file will not open immediately but the editor selection dialog will appear instead. In case you get bored with having to make a choice - the "Always use the selected program" checkbox will come to your rescue.
<LI>Now you can assign more than just a text editor to the F4 button. For example, EXE-files can be opened in a hexadecimal editor (e.g. WinHEX) or in a resource editor (e.g. PE Explorer). It is also possible to pack executables with UPX. All that can be easily realized by editing ChoiceEditor.ini<BR> Now after pressing F4 you have only to select the necessary action :)</UL>
